# Compiling Java Examples

This folder contains two Java examples: `InsecureSerialization.java` and `SecureSerialization.java`. To compile these examples, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the Java files.
2. Run the command `javac *.java` to compile all the Java files in the folder.
3. If the compilation is successful, a class file will be generated for each Java file.
4. To run a specific example, use the command `java ExampleClassName` where `ExampleClassName` is the name of the class containing the main method.

For example, to run the `InsecureSerialization` example on a Windows machine, use the command `java -cp . InsecureSerialization calc.exe`.
