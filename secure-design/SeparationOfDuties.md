# 1 A marketing company hires a new developer to manage their clients websites. Activities of the developer include:
```
1. Update the infrastructure of the websites
2. Update the content of the websites
3. Code changes requested to the websites
4. Deploy changes to the websites
5. Manage the databases of the websites
6. Retrieve the billing information of the clients infrastructure
```
How could be implemented separation of duties if there is a single developer?
